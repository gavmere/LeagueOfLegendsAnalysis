# League of Legends - Red Side or Blue Side?

This League of Legends project was developed as the final project for DSC 80 at UC San Diego. This project involved stepping through the various stages of the Data Science Life Cycle; the steps involved in reaching the final conclusions of the project included exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, assessment for missingness, hypothesis testing, the creation of a baseline model and an improved final model, and a fairness analysis for the model. The overall goal of the project was to determine whether either one of the sides in League of Legends has a significant advantage over the other side.
